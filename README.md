# Automation_Scripts
Creating scripts to automate processes on various operating systems

# Script Backup
Short python script that uses shutil library to backup a my folder of scripts to USB and vice versa. Can also be used with my laptop to keep both machines in sync. First it removes the old folder and then creates a copy of the most up to date version. It does this to circumvent copytree's inability to create a file if it exists already.

Features user choice for the folowing:
Desktop to USB
USB to Desktop
Laptop to USB
USB to Laptop

# Time Desync Alert
Obviously should address the hardware issue but my system clock desyncs at random times. This script will alert me when that happens.
